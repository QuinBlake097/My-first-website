        <p class = "large">I've mostly had an avrage life like most, but one thing made me differnt was a condition I wasn't told about or understood until i was way older. I was born with Autism, a spectrum condition that is differnt for anyone whose born with it; it can range from people not being able to speak or very violnt tempers, to someone whose very articulate. <br> I was fortunate to be born in the middle of said spectrum but it dosen't mean I don't have my own share of problems, habits and trigers. Over the years I've learnt to deal with my condition and the intentional or unintentional bulling, lack of undersanding and/ or being sometime treadted like a child.
        </p>

        <p class = "large">I think the only way I'm somewhat different, is how I grow up really. I was born in Milton Keynes and was brought up on my dad's narrowboat which meant we never really stayed in one place for more then two weeks at the most. <br> It wasn't a bad life but not a particularly good one ether, but I enjoyed it ether way; this type of lifestyle was probably a somewhat big contributer to my social anxiety along with my Aurstim. My Mum took us (me and my brother) off the boat when we were getting around education age, we've permanently lived Bolton ever since and it is were my Mum found out about my condition.</p>
