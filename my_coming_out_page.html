    <h1>When I knew I was gay.</h1>

    <p class = "large">I'm not like most people who believe they were "born": Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, whichever someone would identify. I've never claimed nor would I ever claim, I wasn't "born" Gay, nobody is born Gay; in my opinion its a choice, everyone including those not in the LGBTQA+ community chose how they'd liked to be identified as.</p>
    <div>
    <p class = "large">I found out I was Gay around year 7 or 8, in secodary school. I just noticed I had more of an eye for guys then girls and over time it turnd into attraction, I officially came out around age 15 to my mum but I came out to my friends a bit earlier to feel comfortable enough to do the same with family. My Mum was a bit confused at first but she accepted me and still dose, What I've slowly noticed is I tend to act more flamboyant then I used to when I was younger but apart from that, personality hasn't changed much for the most part.</p>
